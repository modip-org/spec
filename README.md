This repository houses various specifications within MODIP.

## `index_spec`
This is the MODIP Index Specification. This is a complex specification which may be used by a MODIP-hosted mod Index, but anyone is allowed to use it for their own purposes.

## `modpack_format`
This is the MODIP Modpack Format, which is a format that is designed for simplicity and that we hope becomes the universal modpack format.
